- Individually customize name, background color and text colors for headers and body of your Palisades.

## Techs used

Palisades was made using .NET 6 and WPF. It uses Material Design In XAML for some part of the UI and Sentry to automagically report issues you could encounters.

Palisade is greatly by [Twometer's NoFences](https://github.com/Twometer/NoFences), which was inspired by [Stardock's Fences](https://www.stardock.com/products/fences/). I didn't want to pay 11â‚¬ but I also wanted to train on WPF.
